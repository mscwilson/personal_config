### My personal settings

For various reasons I ended up setting up my workspace fresh three times in the space of three months, with increasing amounts of things to install each time. Now that I find myself needing to start again for a fourth time, this repo contains as much of my existing settings as possible, for an easier transfer.

Changed from Sublime to VSCode!
